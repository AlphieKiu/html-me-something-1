                        My freshman year was pretty average. I joind the football and wrestling team, and i was going to join another sport but had an injury so i had to just do weight lifting until footbal season came arouind again. For me freashman year was the most boring year out of the four because
                        there wasnt much that realy happend thats worth talking about. I would say this pretty much sums up my fist year of high school so im just going to move on to my sophomore year.

                        Sophomore year was a little better because i took this very real and origional photo of me and use it to land some small movie rolls for like student films to make some extra cash. Some people say that the photo looks like they have seen it befor but i think thats just because of 
                        how great it is. I didnt start the student film thing till after football season was over and real only started to do it because i didnt want to continue with wrestling anymore. So i did this until about mid summer because by that time the season was starting back up wich leads us 
                        into my junior year.

                        junior year got a little creazy because about late november time i was asked to join a program called I.M.F and i had to help them with a task that they said is probably impossible. After joining the people from I.M.F told me that i had take down a highly trained terrorist group call
                        the syndicate, but my parents said i couldnt go so they got some guy named Tom to go do it i think. it kinda sucked not being able to go stop a huge terrorist group but its whatever i guess i just continued with going to the weight room and working on school. That pretty much wraps up 
                        what happend in my junior year, just the usual.

                        My senior year was by far the craziest out of all four years. i started the year by joining DECA wich i have absolutely no idea what it is, all i knew is that is had a trip to New York that let me miss a week of school. After the trip to New York every thing was pretty normal for mostly the 
                        rest of the year, but then i graduated and everything change because that meant that i would nott have to show back up to school which was pretty dope. and there you have it thats just about all the main things that i did in high school and thanks for reading
